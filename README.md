## Kevin's Timezone Comparison App

One day I was trying to figure out when would be the best time to have a phone call with someone on the other side of the planet. It was difficult to keep track of the times as they flipped back and forth from day to night. So, I thought an app might help.

The frontend was built with create-react-app using React and Redux, and Redux-thunk. I needed a simple backend so I could hide my Google Key. I use Google's excellent map and geolocation API.

The repo for this is here and a working version of the app is at my portfolio site at kevinsmithwebdev.com
